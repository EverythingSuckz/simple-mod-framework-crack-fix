# simple-mod-framework

A mod framework for HITMAN 3 (this fork supports the use of a cracked HITMAN 3 game) that allows the automatic synthesis of mods from source files.

You can download an artifact (nightly) version of the framework from [here](https://nightly.link/EverythingSuckz/simple-mod-framework-crack-fix/workflows/artifact/main/Output.zip).

> [!WARNING]
> This project is intended for educational purposes only. The use of pirated software is illegal and unethical. We strongly discourage the use of this framework with pirated copies of HITMAN 3 or any other software. 
> Modifying games can enhance the gaming experience, but it is important to respect the intellectual property rights of game developers and publishers. If you enjoy a game, please support the creators by purchasing a legitimate copy. Using cracked versions of software can also expose your computer to security risks, including viruses and malware.
> By using this framework, you agree to use it responsibly and in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.
